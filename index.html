        re the key benefits of water recycling according to the article:

        <ol>
          <li>Creates a sustainable water supply - Recycled water provides a reliable local water source and reduces dependence on imported water. This helps communities be more resilient against droughts and other disruptions.</Creates></li>
        
        <li>money - Using recycled water is often cheaper than importing water from other regions. It also reduces costs associated with building new infrastructure for untreated water.</li>
        
        <Protects the environment - Water recycling reduces demand on potable water sources, allowing more water to remain in rivers, lakes, streams and groundwater reserves to support the environment. It also reduces discharges to the ocean.
        
        Supports green spaces - Recycled water is commonly used for irrigation of parks, golf courses, cemeteries and other green spaces. This keeps plants and grass alive during dry periods.
        
        Stimulates local economy - Water recycling programs create local jobs in construction, operations and maintenance. This spending circulates within the community and region.
        
        Public health protection - By reusing water for non-potable uses like irrigation and industrial processes, it preserves drinking water quality for uses where health is a priority.
        
        So in summary, water recycling provides environmental, economic and social benefits for communities through a sustainable water supply.
